PAY ATTENTION to corner cases.

Cannot figure out an elegant way to handle all possible corner cases on my own, reference leetcode discussion here:
https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/3631/a-readable-java-implementation

Like how this solution resolves the case (6, 0) and (Integer.MAX_VALUE, 1), things like that.
