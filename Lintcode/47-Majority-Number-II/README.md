Based on Majority Number I, now we need to filter 1/3, so setup two numbers, with two counters accordingly.

And the answer is in the two numbers after one round scan. Do not have any idea to tell which one is the answer, so need to scan once more and calculate.

Space O(1), Time O(n).

PAY Attention to varieties of edge cases, like (1), (2, 2) (1,2,3,2)

Note that the return value here is not good, there could be multiple values qualified for the result set.
