This is binary search. -1 to adjust the upper bound, 1 to adjust the lower bound, and 0 to return. O(logn)

TLE for (2147483647, 2147483647)
NOTE:
guess(num) would take some time to run, which is counted into the complexity of the whole algorithm, so try to min the use.

upper= mid-1;
lower= mid+1;
help speed up the process a little bit.
