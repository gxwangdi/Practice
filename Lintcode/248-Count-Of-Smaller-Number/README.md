Not sure why it is suggested that we finish problem Segment Tree Build and Segment Tree Query II first.

binary search can resolve this problem. Define the problem as "Find the biggest index of target element, if not, the last element that smaller than the target element. "

And to change the binary search template a little bit works.

Space O(1), Time O(nlogn + klogn) = O(nlogn)
