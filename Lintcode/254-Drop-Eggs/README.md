It asks for the worst case of drops.

If taking a stride, like 10 steps, then after the first egg is broken, the second will need to go a linear process from 1~9. Then it is n/10 + (10-1)

Thinking of that for each stride, we reduce the linear process by 1, then it takes 10 steps for the first stride, 9 for the second, and it goes on.

From jiuzhang, if starting from 1, then we do not need to explore the number of steps for the first stride.
