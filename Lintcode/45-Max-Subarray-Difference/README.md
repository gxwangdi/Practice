This can be divided into two sub-problem.

First sub-problem:
divide the whole array into two non-overlapping parts, can let the iterator 
go from 1 to n-2.

Second sub-problem:
find max-subarray in the first half, min-subarray in the second half, or 
vice versa.

And get the max difference from the max and min collective results. It is 
like to write max-Subarray four times.
