This is really, really binary search after binary search.

BSearch first column, get the lowest position that matrix[i](0) <= target;
In rows j = 0~i, get the lowest position that matrix[j](matrix(j).length-1) < target;
for rows k = (j+1)~i, do binary search for target.
Space O(1) Time O(nlogm)

==========================================
Search online and find a simple implementation, which has O(m+n) solution.

Starting from the top right corner, and compare target and matrix[i](j), 
if matrix[i](j) < target, then the row does not have target, i++;
if matrix[i](j) > target, then the column does not have target, j++;
If it goes outside the boundary, then matrix does not contain target, return false;
