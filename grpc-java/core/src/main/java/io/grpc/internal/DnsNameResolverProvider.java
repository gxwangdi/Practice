/**
 * A provider for {@link DnsNameResolver}.
 *
 * <p>It resolves a target URI whose scheme is {@code "dns"}. The (optional) authority of the target
 * URI is reserved for the address of alternative DNS server (not implemented yet). The path of the
 * target URI, excluding the leading slash {@code '/'}, is treated as the host name and the optional
 * port to be resolved by DNS. Example target URIs:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code "dns:///foo.googleapis.com:8080"} (using default DNS)</li>
 *   <li>{@code "dns://8.8.8.8/foo.googleapis.com:8080"} (using alternative DNS (not implemented
 *   yet))</li>
 *   <li>{@code "dns:///foo.googleapis.com"} (without port)</li>
