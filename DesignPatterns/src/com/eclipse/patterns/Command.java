/**
 * The main disadvantage of the Command pattern is a proliferation of
little classes that either clutters up the main class if they are inner or clutters
up the program namespace if they are outer classes.
Now even in the case where we put all of our actionPerformed events
in a single basket, we usually call little private methods to carry out the actual
function. It turns out that these private methods are just about as long as our
little inner classes, so there is frequently little difference in complexity
between inner and outer class approaches.
