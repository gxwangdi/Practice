	 * In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N

	 * starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom 
	 * (e g , each disk sits on top of an even larger one) You have the 
	 * following constraints:
	 * (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time;
	 * (B) A disk is sliding on the top of one rod onto the next rod;
	 * (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
	 * 
	 * Write a program to move the disks from the rest rod to the last 
	 * using Stacks.
