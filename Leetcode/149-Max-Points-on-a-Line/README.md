Will somebody test this in an onsite interview?  This is ....   

Well, pay attention to 
1. double comparison;
2. duplicate points in input;
3. the line is vertical, that is, x0==x1.           

 y = kx+b,   if (x1, y1) and (x0, y0) determines the line, then k = (y0-y1)/(x0-x1).  

if a and b determines k1, a and c determines k2, if k1 == k2, then a, b and c are on the same line!
