[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/)

There are a row of _n_ houses, each house can be painted with one of the _k_ colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `_n_ x _k_` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note:**  
All costs are positive integers.
