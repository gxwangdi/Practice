Recursively use DFS should get an answer.  But need to figure out a way to measure available spots.   

It is easy for vertical and horizontal, what about rectangle?         

Find a reference here that is align to my approach.  Note that besides ocp45, we need to handle ocp135.  

And pay attention to how it solves the index for ocp45, ocp135.      
And the process is simple and straightforward.
