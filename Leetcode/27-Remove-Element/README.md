Basically two pointers.   

One is from beginning, looking for a match, one is from the end, looking for not match, and swap.  Need to record how many times the swap happens.   

Space O(1)  Time O(n)       A lot of corner cases to be considered. 
=================================================

Another two pointer approach, from the same direction, always fill slot with unmatch value.   basically calculate how many unmatch cha it has.    

Space O(1)  Time O(n).
