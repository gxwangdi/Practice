Basically level order, or width first traversal.  Set a flag to check if this order is done.  Could use a loop or recursion.     

Space O(n), Time O(n)    time limit exceeded.   
=================================================
Use recursion to aggregate left subtree and right subtree height, and see if there is any one not balanced. 

Space O(logn) Time O(n)
