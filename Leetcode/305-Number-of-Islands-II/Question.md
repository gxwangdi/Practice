# 305. Number of Islands II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands-ii/)

A 2d grid map of `m` rows and `n` columns is initially filled with water. We may perform an _addLand_ operation which turns the water at position (row, col) into a land. Given a list of positions to operate, **count the number of islands after each _addLand_ operation**. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example:**

Given `m = 3, n = 3`, `positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]`.  
Initially, the 2d grid `grid` is filled with water. (Assume 0 represents water and 1 represents land).

<pre>0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
</pre>

Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land.

<pre>1 0 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
</pre>

Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land.

<pre>1 1 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
</pre>

Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land.

<pre>1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 2
0 0 0
</pre>

Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land.

<pre>1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 3
0 1 0
</pre>

We return the result as an array: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`

**Challenge:**

Can you do it in time complexity O(k log mn), where k is the length of the `positions`?
