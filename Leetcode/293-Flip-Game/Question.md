# 293. Flip Game

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/)

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two **consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

For example, given `s = "++++"`, after one move, it may become one of the following states:

<pre>[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
</pre>

If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.
