Well, I think my solution for 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters   works pretty well here, just change 2 to k in the code.   

Well, turns out to be a little bit different : ) You will need to pay attention to s.length() < k+1,   and when k == 1 or something.  remove j, which, in turn, is a better version for 159.
