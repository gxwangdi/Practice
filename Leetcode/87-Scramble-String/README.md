This looks like anagram, but the order is not randomly swap like anagram, it has constraints.   The thing is, the binary tree is not necessarily a balance tree, it can be built in a random way.  So need to figure out the right split first,   and check recursively the two substring if they are scramble.

One accepted solution is to list all possible true case.
