# 244. Shortest Word Distance II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii/)

This is a **follow up** of [Shortest Word Distance](/problems/shortest-word-distance). The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called _repeatedly_ many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words _word1_ and _word2_ and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,  
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given _word1_ = `“coding”`, _word2_ = `“practice”`, return 3.  
Given _word1_ = `"makes"`, _word2_ = `"coding"`, return 1.

**Note:**  
You may assume that _word1_ **does not equal to** _word2_, and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.
