No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [A, B] where:

A and B are No-Zero integers.
A + B = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
