Basically link the nodes in recursive manner.  

link left child and right child first, and link move on.   

PAY ATTENTION that only when left and right is not equal then we do 
link(left, left); 
link(right, right);

Space O(logn).     

level order, put left in first. 

PAY ATTENTION to the Note, this is what you will need to communicate with Interviewer!
