First round to compare bulls, then remove bulls , 

to sort both strings Time O(nlogn), Space O(1)
to use a map for one string, then Time O(n), Space O(1)       

===================Check solution  online=====================
The idea is to iterate over the numbers in secret and in guess and count all bulls right away. For cows maintain an array that stores count of the number appearances in secret and in guess.
