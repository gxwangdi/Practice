# 370. Range Addition

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/)

Assume you have an array of length **_n_** initialized with all **0**'s and are given **_k_** update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: **[startIndex, endIndex, inc]** which increments each element of subarray **A[startIndex ... endIndex]** (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with **inc**.

Return the modified array after all **_k_** operations were executed.

**Example:**

<pre>Given:

    length = 5,
    updates = [
        [1,  3,  2],
        [2,  4,  3],
        [0,  2, -2]
    ]

Output:

    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
</pre>

**Explanation:**

<pre>Initial state:
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
[ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]

After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
[ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]

After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
</pre>

**Hint:**

[Show Hint](#)

1.  Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.[Show More Hint](#)
2.  For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?[Show More Hint](#)
3.  Update only the first and end element is sufficient.[Show More Hint](#)
4.  The optimal time complexity is O(**_k_** + **_n_**) and uses O(1) extra space.
