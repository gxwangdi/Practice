Hint:
Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.     
For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?   
Update only the first and end element is sufficient.          
The optimal time complexity is O(k + n) and uses O(1) extra space.

Cannot figure out at this time.   Well, just references a posting https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/49674/java-o-n-k-time-o-1-space-with-algorithm-explained/2            

It uses a suffix sum,  O(n) complexity.
