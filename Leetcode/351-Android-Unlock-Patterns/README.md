Looks like the pattern, the order matters.  This is a permutation problem, rather than a combination problem.  

We will need to use recursive manner to deal with it, as it is much more complicated than permutation I and II.

It is simple and straight forward to use a skip matrix to indicate the dependency,  if the input size is limited.
