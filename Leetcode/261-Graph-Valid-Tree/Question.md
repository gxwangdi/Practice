# 261. Graph Valid Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

For example:

Given `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]`, return `true`.

Given `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]`, return `false`.

**Hint:**

1.  Given `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, what should your return? Is this case a valid tree? [Show More Hint](#)
2.  According to the [definition of tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)): “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”

**Note**: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.
