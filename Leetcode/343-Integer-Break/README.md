Hint:
There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.      
You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10 to discover the regularities.                    


For example, 8 = 4+4, when two factors are as close as possible, then the multiply is biggest.   Pay attention to the couple of edge case when it comes to the number like 2,3,4 5.  
==========================================
Approach above does not work, it assumes only two factors, but what if there are multiple factors? Then it should be as average as possible.       

Then it needs a DP solution.
