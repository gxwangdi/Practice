Put all elements in nums1 into a set, which automatically remove duplicate elements, and compare with each one in nums2, 

When matching, add the element into result set, remove the element from set in case result has duplicate elements. Well, result could be a set too. 

Space O(min(nums1.length, nums2.length)), time O(nums1.length+nums2.length)
