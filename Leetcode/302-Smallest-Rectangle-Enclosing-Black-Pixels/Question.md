# 302. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rectangle-enclosing-black-pixels/)

An image is represented by a binary matrix with `0` as a white pixel and `1` as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location `(x, y)` of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

For example, given the following image:

<pre>[
  "0010",
  "0110",
  "0100"
]
</pre>

and `x = 0`, `y = 2`,

Return `6`.
