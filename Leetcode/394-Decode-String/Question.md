# 394. Decode String

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the _encoded_string_ inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly _k_ times. Note that _k_ is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, _k_. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

**Examples:**

<pre>s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
</pre>
