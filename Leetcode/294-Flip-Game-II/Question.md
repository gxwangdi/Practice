# 294. Flip Game II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii/)

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two **consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

For example, given `s = "++++"`, return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle `"++"` to become `"+--+"`.
