We can do a dfs search.     

For each node, we get an int array,   max[0] means current node is not robbed, then we get result from next level, max[1] means current node is robbed, then we take current node.    

At first I was thinking like, get inorder tranversal, and insert 0 in appropriate places. So far have not got it working.
