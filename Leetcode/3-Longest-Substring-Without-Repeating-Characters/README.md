DO NOT think over-complecated algorithm at first. Implement a correct one is more important !

Use a var max to record the max length of any qualified substring.

Use a map to check if substring is qualified, all values should be 1 to be qualified.

===================================
DO NOT think over-complecated, if it is like min string window, then it will be problematic.

Using a 256 size boolean array can do the job.

process is almost the same.
